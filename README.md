### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi there!	
I'm hye rim, Data-Analyst growing in real time.	
I have majored Interaction Science in SKKU DxLab.
My undergraduate major was statistics and sub major was economics
Also, I had participated in Big-data academy for 2 years and my role was a vice-chairman.

I'm interested in "user-oriented data" and I thought that media contents are the suitable topic to analysis user's behavior and taste.
Now I studied about the media contents toward the human.
I appreciate the value of the data generated by people's behaviors and want to analyze them.
