### Hi there 👋

Hello, I'm Hye-rim Yu, a third semester master's student currently enrolled in the Department of Interaction Science at Sungkyunkwan University.  While studying statistics and mathematical theories at Dongguk University, I naturally became interested in data analysis, and based on that interest, I went to graduate school and am currently working on various machine learning and deep learning projects.

In graduate school, I met colleagues with various majors and interests, which naturally broadened my sights. My interest is 'Deep learning application'. I'm thinking and researching about how to devise a more efficient and convenient system by utilizing unstructured data and applying machine learning and deep learning techniques.  In detail, I am interested in recommendation systems, and I always find it new and interesting to read papers related to my research and interests and gain new research insights.
